    Abstract

One of the best known features of actin filaments is their helical
structure. A number of essential properties emerge from this molecular
arrangement of actin subunits. Here, we give an overview of the
mechanical and biochemical implications of filament helicity, at
different scales. In particular, a number of recent studies have
highlighted the role of filament helicity in the adaptation to and the
generation of mechanical torsion
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mechanical-torsion>, and in the modulation of the filament’s interaction with very different actin-binding proteins (such as myosins, cross-linkers, formins <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/formins>, and cofilin). Helicity can thus be seen as a key factor for the regulation of actin assembly, and as a link between biochemical regulators and their mechanical context. In addition, actin filament helicity appears to play an essential role in the establishment of chirality <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/chirality> at larger scales, up to the organismal scale. Altogether, helicity appears to be an essential feature contributing to the regulation of actin assembly dynamics, and to actin’s ability to organize cells at a larger scale.

    1. Introduction: helical structure of the actin filament

Helicity is a common feature in biopolymers
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/biopolymer>. In the case of actin filaments, helicity is an essential characteristic which can be linked to several key properties of the filaments. We begin here by introducing the main parameters and numbers used to describe actin filament helicity. The following sections will address the mechanical implications of actin filament helicity (Section 2 <#sec0010>), the role of helicity in the interactions of filaments with actin-binding proteins (Section 3 <#sec0015>) and the role it plays in transmitting chirality <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/chirality> across scales (Section 4 <#sec0040>).

In the years that followed the discovery of actin filaments by the
laboratory of Albert Szent-Györgyi in the 1940's (see Bugyi and
Kellermayer [1 <#bib0005>] for a review of these fascinating early days
of actin research), X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/electron-microscopy> studies detected a periodicity (larger than the subunit size) in the structure of actin fibers [2 <#bib0010>,3 <#bib0015>]. The helical structure suggested by these early observations [2 <#bib0010>] was nicely confirmed by negative staining <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/negative-staining> electron microscopy a few years later [[4] <#bib0020>, [5] <#bib0025>, [6] <#bib0030>] and its right-handedness (viewing the filament as a double helix) was clearly established [7 <#bib0035>].

Since then, with the advent of more sensitive detectors and refined
algorithms, more studies using EM or X-ray diffraction have consolidated
our description of actin filaments as helices [[8] <#bib0040>, [9]
<#bib0045>, [10] <#bib0050>, [11] <#bib0055>, [12] <#bib0060>, [13]
<#bib0065>]. Today, helicity is a textbook feature of actin filaments.

The actin filament can be described as a single, left-handed helix, with
a short pitch (indicated by orange lines in Fig. 1 <#fig0005>A) where
each subunit is rotated by -167° with respect to its neighbor. It is
along this helix that subunits are added at the end of the filament, as
it polymerizes. The actin filament can also be viewed as a double helix,
which is perhaps easier to visualize, where two strands of actin
subunits are intertwined (red lines in Fig. 1 <#fig0005>A). They are
stabilized by interactions between neighboring subunits of the same
strand (intra-strand, or longitudinal interactions), and between strands
(inter-strand, or lateral interactions). Based on assembly kinetics at
filament ends [14 <#bib0070>,15 <#bib0075>], thermodynamic
considerations and modes have led to estimate the energy of longitudinal
contacts to be 12–20 kT and that of lateral contacts to be 4–8 kT [[16]
<#bib0080>, [17] <#bib0085>, [18] <#bib0090>]. The standard value for
the half-pitch (or crossover distance) of the double helix is 36 nm, a
distance which embraces 13 actin subunits. The double helix thus makes
one full turn every 72 nm, i.e. it makes 13.9 turns per micrometer.
Within each strand, each subunit is rotated by approximately +27° with
respect to its longitudinal neighbor. Unless specified otherwise, in
this review we are always referring to the right-handed, two-start, long
pitch helix.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of an actin filament.

A. Actin monomers are sketched as spheres, the two strands are
represented in different shades of gray, for clarity. The black dots are
here to indicate the orientation of the monomers, which are rotated by
+27° with respect to their longitudinal neighbors. The pitch of the
double helix is 72 nm, corresponding to 13.9 turns per micrometer. It is
straightforward to see the actin filament as this right-handed,
two-start, long-pitch helix (indicated by the red lines), but it can
also be described as a left-handed, one-start, short-pitch helix
(indicated by the orange line).

B. Actin filaments are chiral: they differ from their mirror image,
which has the opposite handedness.

The numbers we have just cited characterize the canonical actin filament
structure. However, one should bear in mind that actin filaments may
adopt slightly different conformations. Early EM studies [4 <#bib0020>]
reported a significant variability of the helical pitch of actin
filaments, and later studies have indicated that this variability in
pitch was not due to sample preparation, but was an intrinsic property
of the actin filament [19 <#bib0095>,20 <#bib0100>], and could be linked
to variations in the conformation of the subunits, in particular that of
their DNAse1-binding loop which is highly variable [21 <#bib0105>]. The
resulting different structural states differ by a few degrees in their
subunits orientations, but they all remain right-handed double-stranded
helices, thereby underlining the robustness of this basic feature. The
idea of structural polymorphism has been disputed, notably by cryo-EM
studies reporting a very low variability in helicity [11 <#bib0055>]. An
explanation for this apparent discrepancy may come from a reduction of
the fluctuations in helical pitch upon application of a tensile force
[[22] <#bib0110>, [23] <#bib0115>, [24] <#bib0120>].

Remarkably, the nucleotide state of the actin subunits, which has a
strong impact on the filament’s depolymerization
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/depolymerization> rate [14 <#bib0070>,25 <#bib0125>,26 <#bib0130>] and on its mechanical properties [27 <#bib0135>] does not seem to affect its helical parameters [13 <#bib0065>,28 <#bib0140>]. Similarly, pH and ionic strength <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ionic-strength>, which are known to affect filament stability and rigidity [[29] <#bib0145>, [30] <#bib0150>, [31] <#bib0155>, [32] <#bib0160>] do not appear to significantly affect the filament’s helical parameters [29 <#bib0145>]. It has been proposed, however, that variability in the occupation of specific cation-binding sites located at the longitudinal interface of subunits could account for the aforementioned structural polymorphism [33 <#bib0165>]. Mechanical tension has also been proposed as a means to alter the conformation of actin filaments [34 <#bib0170>].

In summary, actin filaments are always observed to have a right-handed
double-helical structure, and it is not entirely clear to what extent
the helical parameters can be altered in the absence of ABPs. In
contrast, as we will see in section 3 <#sec0015>, ABPs can induce
significant changes of the helical pitch, which provides a handle to
modulate filament properties.


    2. Mechanical implications of actin filament helicity

Before discussing how ABPs can modulate filament helicity (Section 3
<#sec0015>) and what consequences it can have at larger scales (Section
4 <#sec0040>), let us briefly summarize some of the physical
consequences of helicity.

An obvious consequence of helicity is that it gives filaments an
inherent periodicity, other than that of the subunits themselves. This
simple feature imposes geometrical constraints when packing filaments
into tight bundles (Section 3.1 <#sec0020>).

Another natural consequence of helicity is that it couples different
mechanical stresses applied to actin filaments. Experimentally, it has
been reported more than 20 years ago that a moderate torque,
over-twisting or under-twisting an actin filament by as little as 0.1
turn/μm, was enough to reduce twofold the tensile force required for
filament rupture [35 <#bib0175>]. To our knowledge, this fascinating
result has never been reproduced. Spectacular experiments where stronger
local stresses were applied, by tying knots in actin filaments with
optical tweezers
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/optical-tweezers>, reduced the tensile force for rupture by two orders of magnitude [36 <#bib0180>]. Theoretical studies have shown that, due to helicity, mechanical twist (torque) is coupled to tension and bending [[37] <#bib0185>, [38] <#bib0190>, [39] <#bib0195>]. Twist-bend coupling, in particular, can be quite strong and is likely to affect the mechanical properties of the filaments [40 <#bib0200>]. Stretch-twist coupling appears to be more moderate, requiring high tensile forces in order to alter the helical pitch of the filament [24 <#bib0120>]. Our recent data [30 <#bib0150>], showing that the action of cofilin <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cofilin> is barely affected by filament tension up to 30 pN (see Section 3.4 <#sec0035>), seem consistent with this view.

The application of a mechanical torque is naturally linked to helicity.
Of course, torque can be applied to non-helical filaments (such as
linear synthetic polymers), however, as we will see in Section 3
<#sec0015>, the actin filament’s helical structure makes it easier for
ABPs to apply a mechanical torque to the filament. Also, a direct
consequence of an applied mechanical torque will be a modification of
the helical pitch of the filament. If the two ends of a filament are
twisted, a torque is applied uniformly along the filament (just as
pulling on the ends would result in a uniform tension along the
filament). Filament regions of identical composition (e.g., bare or
decorated by an ABP) will thus be identically deformed by the applied
torque, and be uniformly under- or over-twisted.

Several papers, including [41 <#bib0205>,42 <#bib0210>], have reported a
torsional rigidity
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mechanical-torsion> of approximately 2 × 10^−27 Nm^2 for actin filaments (corresponding to a torsional persistence length of approximately 500 nm), while others [35 <#bib0175>,43 <#bib0215>] find filaments to be 10- to 40-fold stiffer. Our recent work [30 <#bib0150>,44 <#bib0220>], using the polarized emission of fluorescence to monitor the orientation of actin subunits around the axis of filaments aligned by microfluidics, finds that this orientation remains steady several micrometers away from the filament’s anchoring point. These observations would agree with the higher values of torsional stiffness. A recent mesoscopic length scale model [45 <#bib0225>] seems to reconcile the different torsional stiffness measurements, by distinguishing a high “filament torsional rigidity” and a weaker “intersubunit torsional rigidity”. This model also predicts that actin filaments are easier to under-twist than to over-twist, as the latter deformation strains longitudinal contacts more than lateral contacts.


    3. Crosstalk between helicity and ABPs

The fact that actin filaments are helical has consequences for several,
very different ABPs. They are both affected by helicity and able to
modify it. Helicity and the mechanical constraints modifying helicity
are thus important parameters for the regulation of actin assembly and
the organization of filament networks.


      3.1. Cross-linkers

Proteins that cross-link actin filaments play an important role in
shaping actin networks and cells. As they connect filaments together,
they can impose a specific filament polarity within the network and they
affect the network’s visco-elastic properties in non-trivial ways [46
<#bib0230>], which eventually determine the mechanical properties of
cells and tissues.

As we have already mentioned in Section 2 <#sec0010>, filament helicity
gives rise to periodicity. This is clearly apparent when filaments are
tightly bundled by small proteins such as fascin
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/fascin> or espin [[47] <#bib0235>, [48] <#bib0240>, [49] <#bib0245>], as bundling puts the binding sites on two neighboring filaments in register (Fig. 2 <#fig0010>B). Note that, depending on the bundling protein, neighboring filaments in the bundle can be parallel or antiparallel. The geometrical packing of the filaments by small cross-linkers have been reported to induce changes in the conformation of the filaments and to depend on crosslinker elasticity [50 <#bib0250>,51 <#bib0255>]. In the case of fascin and espin, these changes in filament helicity are either continuous or discrete, respectively. The angle between longitudinal actin subunit neighbors was reported to decrease by as much as ∼2° (thereby increasing the half-pitch of the double helix to ∼39 nm) [51 <#bib0255>].

Fig. 2. Filament helicity and ABPs.

A. Myosin V takes steps that are shorter than the half-pitch of the
actin double helix (the subunits marked in red indicate myosin V’s
stepping positions). As a consequence, myosin V follows a left-handed
helix as it moves along the filament.

B. Actin filaments bundled by fascin
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/fascin> adopt a regular geometrical packing. Motors (like myosin X) must take 36 nm steps in order to walk along the bundle in a straight line (stepping on the subunits that are circled in red). The change in helical pitch induced by fascin bundling is not visible on this sketch. Note that bundles are typically in 3 dimensions, adding constraints for motors to walk on filaments having more than 2 neighbors.

C. A formin tracking the elongating barbed end of an anchored actin
filament must be free to rotate in order to follow the helical pitch. If
the formin cannot rotate, the filament cannot incorporate new turns and
becomes under-twisted (potentially missing up to a maximum of 13.9
turns/μm, if the filament is fully assembled straight). If formins
cannot rotate but are able to relax some torsional stress, filaments may
be mildly undertwisted (a situation intermediate to the two extremes
that are sketched here).

D. Cofilin forms domains as it binds cooperatively to the sides of an
actin filament. The pitch of cofilactin (cofilin-decorated actin)
filaments is shorter than that of actin filaments. If the filament is
free to rotate as it gets decorated by cofilin, bare filament regions
and cofilin-decorated regions are both able to adopt their natural
helicity. If the filament cannot rotate, no new turns can be added as
cofilin binds, and both regions will be under-twisted.

The binding energy of an ABP is typically a few kT, significantly larger
than the energy required to moderately alter the filament’s helicity
(twisting a 36 nm segment by 5 degrees, for example, will cost between
0.06 kT and 0.7 kT, depending on the value chosen for the torsional
rigidity
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mechanical-torsion> - see Section 2 <#sec0010>). Nevertheless, when bundling actin filaments, their helical structure represents a significant geometrical constraint and imposes an additional energy cost. As a result, bundle size seems to reach a maximum of ∼ 20 filaments for fascin-induced bundles /in vitro/, though slightly larger bundles have been observed in the filopodia <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/filopodia> of glioma cells [52 <#bib0260>]. Theoretical studies propose that bundle twist spontaneously arises from filament bundling, depending on the relative elasticity of filaments and bundlers. Bundle assembly can thus generate a torque at the scale of both individual filaments and the whole bundle [53 <#bib0265>]. The energy cost associated with filament twisting may play a role in the function of the acrosomal bundle of Limulus <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/limulus> sperm (cross-linked by scruin), where the energy stored in the deformed filaments is rapidly released and drives the penetration of the egg [54 <#bib0270>]. A recent theoretical study shows that, when cross-linking filaments, the geometrical constraints caused by filament helicity can lead to the storage of elastic energy by the cross-linkers, and proposes that this mechanism could be relevant in the context of endocytosis <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/endocytosis> [55 <#bib0275>].


      3.2. Myosins

Myosins are a large family of cytoskeletal motor proteins, involved in
most cellular processes, as they power muscle contraction, transport
cargo, and participate in actin-based membrane deformation (see [56
<#bib0280>] for a review). While the motor domain, which comprises the
actin and ATP binding sites, is quite conserved, the tail domain (lever
arm) of myosins is highly divergent and specifies the localization and
motor function of the different myosin family members. Myosins use actin
filaments as tracks, along which they move by converting the chemical
energy of ATP into mechanical work. With the exception of myosin VI, all
studied myosins thus far move towards actin filament barbed ends.
Two-headed myosins can move processively.

Actin filaments thus present a set of discrete binding sites for
myosins, arranged in a helicoidal fashion. When stepping along the
filament, a limited set of sites will be accessible to the myosin for
each step, depending on the myosin’s lever arm and step size. This has
important consequences for myosin movement. For example, myosin V, which
has a step size slightly shorter than the filament’s half-pitch,
alternates steps on each of the two actin filament strands and moves
along a left-handed spiral [57 <#bib0285>] (see Fig. 2 <#fig0010>A).

When filaments are organized into a parallel bundle, myosins cannot
rotate around the filaments. This additional geometrical constraint
makes it difficult for most myosin motors to walk along filament
bundles, except for myosin X which seems optimized for this task. First,
it is able to take 36 nm steps and walk straight along a single filament
[58 <#bib0290>,59 <#bib0295>] (Fig. 2 <#fig0010>B). Second, myosin X’s
ability to take steps of different sizes (up to 52 nm) allows it to step
onto neighboring filaments in the bundle, and thereby increase its
velocity and run-length, compared to single filaments [59 <#bib0295>].
Side-stepping has been confirmed in cells, for myosin X walking in
filopodia [60 <#bib0300>].

When myosins are not transporting cargo, they can be anchored and exert
pulling forces on actin filaments. Due to the helical nature of the
filaments, myosins can also easily exert a torque on the filaments [61
<#bib0305>]. In a gliding assay, this torque can cause filaments to
rotate around their main axis [62 <#bib0310>] or to supercoil [63
<#bib0315>,64 <#bib0320>] (Note that one should be cautious, however,
when conducting such experiments since a change of helicity can be
artificially photo-induced on actin filaments stabilized with labeled
phalloidin [65 <#bib0325>]). Applying a torque to actin filaments may
also modify their helical pitch, and alter their interactions with other
ABPs. The myosin II motor domain has been reported to have an increased
affinity for stretched filaments in cells [66 <#bib0330>]. This
observation might be related to the stretch-twist coupling of actin
filaments mentioned in Section 2 <#sec0010>.


      3.3. Formins

Formins
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/formins> are involved in the generation of several actin filament networks in cells [67 <#bib0335>]. Formins are protein homodimers that can track the actin filament barbed end and promote its elongation from profilin-actin [68 <#bib0340>]. The fact that a formin remains processively bound to the growing barbed end [[69] <#bib0345>, [70] <#bib0350>, [71] <#bib0355>] raises the question of its ability to rotate in order to follow the filament helix [72 <#bib0360>]. In cells, formin-elongated filaments are typically connected to other filaments within networks, and are thus likely to be unable to rotate around their axis. Formin anchoring to membranes, either directly or via regulatory proteins, can potentially allow formin rotation, which appears to be required in order to generate actin filaments with their natural helicity.

Monitoring the polarized emission of fluorescence from a single labeled
actin subunit [62 <#bib0310>], Mizuno et al [73 <#bib0365>] were able to
directly observe the rotation of actin filaments growing from artificial
formin mDia1
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mdia1> aggregates. More recently, using EM, the same authors reported that filaments growing from such formin aggregates while their pointed ends were anchored, thereby preventing their rotation, had a slightly larger helical pitch [74 <#bib0370>]. In principle, a non-rotating formin elongating an anchored filament could generate a large amount of under-twisting, as the newly added subunits are added without helicity (see Fig. 2 <#fig0010>C). The very mild under-twisting observed by Mizuno et al. could indicate that filaments were very briefly elongated by formins before stalling, or perhaps that formins elongated these filaments by alternating between torque-generating and torque-relaxing steps, as proposed theoretically [72 <#bib0360>]. The details of formin anchoring, and their ability to rotate, certainly play an important role.

When applying tension to filaments elongated by formin mDia1, Yu et al.
observed very different elongation rates depending on how they anchored
formins [75 <#bib0375>,76 <#bib0380>]. The elongating filaments were not
free to rotate, and these results could be consistently interpreted in
terms of formin rotational freedom, with the seemingly more permissive
anchoring leading to the faster elongation rate.

Recently, we have monitored the impact of filament bundling by fascin,
which effectively blocks filament rotation, on the activity of formin
mDia1 at their barbed ends [44 <#bib0220>]. We found that, when
filaments were bundled, the amount of rotational and translational
freedom of the anchored formins mattered greatly: while the activity of
freely rotating formins anchored on lipid bilayers
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipid-bilayer> was not affected by filament bundling, rotation-constrained formins anchored on glass elongated the bundled filaments more slowly, and for a shorter amount of time before detaching from their barbed ends. The efficient cross-talk between geometrical constraints on filaments (bundling) and on formins (anchoring), several micrometers apart, indicates that actin filaments can transmit torsional stress over long distances.

Notably, Zimmermann et al observed that filament elongation by yeast
fomin Cdc12 was not affected when filament rotation was blocked, in the
absence of a pulling force [77 <#bib0385>]. This result suggests that
Cdc12 was able to rotate around its anchoring point and applied no
torque to the filament, or that Cdc12 is better than mDia1 at coping
with torsional stress.

The filament elongation rate as well as the formin detachment rate we
measured for mDia1 did not appear to vary over time, nor to depend on
the formin-to-bundle distance, suggesting that the torque did not
increase continuously over the course of elongation. This may indicate
that, beyond a certain amount of torsional stress, the formin was able
to rotate around its anchoring point, thereby imposing a limit on the
torque. It may also indicate, like the EM observations of Mizuno et al.
[74 <#bib0370>], that the processive elongation by formins includes
steps where torsional stress is relaxed, as proposed theoretically [72
<#bib0360>].

Together, these recent papers indicate that, due to filament helicity,
anchored formins can apply a torque when elongating rotation-hindered
actin filaments. Such situations are likely to be encountered in cells,
where formins are anchored to surfaces and filaments are interconnected.
The applied torque has a strong impact on the formin’s ability to
efficiently elongate the filaments (at least for formin mDia1). A
consequence of this torque is that the elongating filament is
under-twisted. At this stage the amplitude of this under-twisting is
unclear, and should be addressed by future studies.


      3.4. Cofilin

Proteins of the actin depolymerizing factor
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/actin-depolymerizing-factor>(ADF)/cofilin family are the central players of actin filament disassembly. Cofilin <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cofilin> disassembles filaments by binding to the sides of ADP-actin filaments, in a cooperative manner, leading to the formation of cofilin domains (Fig. 2 <#fig0010>D). These segments of cofilin-decorated actin (referred to as “cofilactin”) adopt a specific conformation [12 <#bib0060>,78 <#bib0390>,79 <#bib0395>], where each subunit is tilted by an additional ∼9.5° with respect to its longitudinal neighbors. The length of the filament is not significantly affected but the helical pitch of cofilactin is shorter, with a half-pitch of approximately 27 nm (thus the cofilactin double helix makes 18.5 full turns per micrometer, compared to 13.9 turns per micrometer for the bare actin filament. See Fig. 2 <#fig0010>D). In comparison, the reported change in helicity induced by fascin or espin bundling is much smaller (see Section 3.1 <#sec0020>). Compared to bare actin, cofilactin filaments have lower torsional and flexural rigidities [41 <#bib0205>,80 <#bib0400>]. Whether the cofilin-induced change in helicity propagates beyond the boundaries of the cofilin domain is debated. Atomic Force Microscopy <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/atomic-force-microscopy> measurements were reported to show that the helical pitch is shortened by cofilin up to 13 subunits away from the cofilin domain towards the pointed end of the filament [81 <#bib0405>] while recent EM measurements indicate that the conformation changes sharply at the domain boundary [82 <#bib0410>].

Severing is enhanced at, or near, the boundaries of cofilin domains [83
<#bib0415>,84 <#bib0420>]. Cofilin-saturated filaments do not sever.
Their pointed ends depolymerize faster than that of bare actin
filaments, and their barbed ends hardly stop depolymerizing even in the
presence of fresh actin monomers and capping protein [30 <#bib0150>,85
<#bib0425>].

The action of cofilin thus appears to be intimately related to helicity.
A consequence of the cofilin-induced change of helicity, is that cofilin
can apply a torque as it decorates actin filaments that are not able to
rotate around their axis. This is the case, for example, for filaments
that are bound to a surface or to other filaments, as many filaments in
cells certainly are. Manipulating single actin filaments in vitro, we
have recently shown that this cofilin-induced torque did not affect
cofilin binding, but that it greatly increased the rate of severing at
domain boundaries [30 <#bib0150>]. As a consequence, cross-linked
filaments are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than free
filaments [30 <#bib0150>,86 <#bib0430>,87 <#bib0435>].

Consistent with the notion that twisting and bending are coupled [39
<#bib0195>] we found that imposing a strong local curvature also
enhanced severing by cofilin [30 <#bib0150>]. However, we found that
tension (up to 30 pN) had almost no effect on cofilin binding nor on
cofilin-induced severing, in contradiction with an earlier study [88
<#bib0440>]. It thus appears that this range of tension does not
significantly affect filament helicity.

When the torque is applied by cofilin itself as it decorates an anchored
filament, like in our experiment [30 <#bib0150>], the filament will be
globally under-twisted by up to approximately 4.6 turns per micrometer
(Fig. 2 <#fig0010>D) (Both bare and cofilin-decorated regions are
under-twisted, compared to their natural helicity. The maximum
undertwist of 4.6 turns per micrometer corresponds to a fully decorated
filament). Remarkably, a recent meso-scale model by Schramm et al [45
<#bib0225>] proposes that the application of a stronger torque could
reduce the affinity of cofilin for the filament. For example, the
cofilin off-rate is predicted to increase significantly when filaments
are under-twisted by more than 6 turns per micrometer, and the effect is
stronger when filaments are over-twisted.

As we have discussed in Section 3.3 <#sec0030>, Mizuno et al [74
<#bib0370>] have used anchored formins and filaments to mildly
under-twist filaments. They report that this mild under-twisting is
enough to protect the filaments from the action of cofilin. This results
appears to be in contradiction with our study on torque-induced cofilin
severing [30 <#bib0150>] and with the model by Schramm et al. [45
<#bib0225>]. More experiments are required to solve this apparent
discrepancy.

Taken together, these results show that under-twisting or over-twisting
actin filaments can modulate the action of ABPs in non-trivial ways.
Importantly, torsional stress can be applied by the same ABPs or by
other ABPs, and depends on the mechanical context of the filaments.


    4. From actin filament helicity to cellular and organismal chiralities

Over the past years, filament helicity and helicity-sensitive ABPs have
been linked to the generation of chirality and asymmetry at larger
scales, which are fundamental aspects of life. The establishment of
left-right asymmetry, in particular, is an important and challenging
question. In development, left-right asymmetry appears after
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral asymmetries, which are determined
at the time of fertilization. Proteins and most biological molecules are
chiral (and actin filaments themselves are chiral, see Fig. 1
<#fig0005>B), but understanding how cell-scale chirality can emerge from
chiral molecular components is not straightforward [89 <#bib0445>].
Today it appears that cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanics are key
elements of this process [90 <#bib0450>]. In the following paragraphs,
we summarize some recent observations that attribute a role to actin
helicity and ABPs in the establishment of cell- and tissue-scale chirality.

Myosins are a clear link between actin helicity and larger-scale
chirality. Recent spectacular work by Lebreton et al [91 <#bib0455>] on
/Drosophila/development shows that the ectopic expression
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ectopic-expression> of myosin-1d induces the directional polarization of cells, a pronounced dextral twisting of the trachea, and a dextral twisting of the whole larval body. In contrast, myosin-1c has an antagonistic effect (sinistral twisting). Strikingly, the difference between the two motors is already apparent at the single filament level in /in vitro/ gliding assays, as myosin-1d propels filaments in a clear counter-clockwise circular movement, and not myosin-1c. The mechanistic details linking these different scales are not clearly known.

Another example can be found in the cortex of /C. elegans/ embryos,
where actomyosin contraction generates torques and drives chiral
cortical flows in one-cell embryos, which later allow the establishment
of left-right asymmetry [92 <#bib0460>,93 <#bib0465>].

In the context of left-right brain asymmetry
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/brain-asymmetry>, the spiral stepping of Myosin V on actin filaments (Fig. 2 <#fig0010>A) has been proposed to drive the left helical movement of growth cone <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/growth-cone>filopodia <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/filopodia>, and to explain the clockwise growth of neurites in two dimensions [94 <#bib0470>]. This model is corroborated by the observation of a rotational retrograde flow of the actin shaft inside filopodia [95 <#bib0475>]. Although there is no direct evidence of their implication in the rotational movement of filopodia, formins <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/formins> and bundling proteins are good candidates to generate the observed twisted super-helical actin bundles, resulting in the chiral movements of filopodia.

Formins have been linked to the establishment of large-scale chirality,
in various contexts. For example, Davison et al. [96 <#bib0480>] have
identified diaphanous-related formins as essential to induce
morphological asymmetry during the early stages of embryo development
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/embryogenesis> in snails and frogs.

Another fascinating example is the appearance of rotating radial fibers
in fibroblasts plated isotropically on 2D adhesive disk patterns [97
<#bib0485>]. Rotation is asymmetrical and its direction is reversed by
overexpression of alpha-actinin (interestingly, alpha-actinin has also
been linked to the actin-dependent, asymmetrical rotation of epithelial
cells confined between two matrigel layers [98 <#bib0490>]). With
keratinocytes
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/keratinocyte>, the same chiral swirling could not develop when cells lacked the formin mDial, but was facilitated in cells lacking VASP, possibly through an increased activity of mDial since both proteins are sometimes described as antagonists [99 <#bib0495>]. The mechanistic interpretation is that the elongation of the filaments in the radial fibers, driven by anchored formins, causes their rotation around their axes, and drives the swirling of the fiber network. These assays have identified myosin II in transverse fibers and formins at focal adhesion <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/focal-adhesion> sites as the active molecular players required for the emergence of chiral swirling in single cells [97 <#bib0485>,99 <#bib0495>]. However, the details linking formin-induced filament rotation to the generation of a rotational movement of the fibers, which are complex filament bundles, are still missing.

Globally, the mechanistic, molecular details of the symmetry-breaking
mechanisms we have summarized here are not fully understood.
Nonetheless, these few examples illustrate how actin filaments, being
helical and thus chiral, may be the necessary intermediate to bridge
chirality across scales.


    5. Conclusion and future directions

As we have discussed in Section 3 <#sec0015>, actin filament helicity is
sensed and modified by various types of ABPs. Helicity thus provides an
essential handle for ABPs to modulate each other’s regulatory actions.
Interestingly, ABPs’ ability to affect the filament’s helicity depends
strongly on the filaments’ geometrical organization. For example,
details of filament and formin anchoring have an impact on the
generation of torque, and on the action of regulatory proteins such as
cofilin. This provides a clear means to regulate protein activity as a
function of the local mechanical context. As such, torsional stress and
the modulation of helicity efficiently contribute to filament-level
mechanotransduction
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mechanotransduction>, for which only a few mechanisms have been identified [100 <#bib0500>,101 <#bib0505>]. While tension has been proposed as a means to alter the filament conformation [34 <#bib0170>] it appears that applying a torque is a direct way to modify the filament’s helical pitch, and to alter the action of ABPs. For these reasons, the modulation of helicity appears to be a powerful and efficient way to regulate actin assembly and organization in cells.

The modulation of helicity as a regulatory parameter is still an
emerging concept, and a lot of questions remain open. As we have
discussed in Section 3.3 <#sec0030>, the amplitude of the torque a
formin can apply to a filament, and the amplitude of the resulting
under-twisting, are still unclear. Also, the different studies we have
cited were mostly focused on formin mDia1
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mdia1>, and other formins are likely to differ in their ability to apply torque and in their response to an applied torque.

Several important ABPs have not been mentioned here and their response
to changes in helicity should be studied in the future. We are confident
that more regulatory mechanisms involving actin helicity and torsional
stress will be uncovered in the coming years. For example,
side-branching by the Arp2/3 complex, which has been shown to be
sensitive to the local curvature of the mother filament [102 <#bib0510>]
is likely to be sensitive to changes in the helical pitch of the mother
filament.

Tropomyosins
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/tropomyosin>constitute a large family of coiled-coil proteins with as many as 40 isoforms <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/isoform> in mammals. Today, tropomyosins appear to play a central role in regulating the binding of many other ABPs to actin filaments [103 <#bib0515>] and to drive actin network differentiation in cells [104 <#bib0520>]. Tropomyosins bind to the sides of actin filaments by spanning over several subunits (up to half a pitch per protein for the longest tropomyosin isoforms) and closely follow the filament strands. It thus appears that tropomyosins should be sensitive to small changes in helicity, even though structural data [105 <#bib0525>] indicate that tropomyosin binding does not modify the filament’s helical pitch. We therefore see tropomyosins as promising candidates for helicity-sensing, and anticipate that this property may be key to understanding their regulatory function.

As we have discussed in section 4 <#sec0040>, the exploitation of the
helical nature of actin filaments by ABPs now appears essential to
establish asymmetries at larger scales. We can view helicity as
filament-scale chirality, and as a necessary link between
molecular-scale chirality and cell-to-tissue-scale chirality. However,
the mechanistic details of how filament helicity translates into
larger-scale asymmetries are still mysterious. The fact that the action
of several ABPs is coupled to filament helicity and torque suggests that
complex, integrated molecular mechanisms are at play.

For instance, in their study of organismal chirality in Drosophila,
Lebreton et al [91 <#bib0455>] report that the body-twisting phenotypes
induced by the ectopic expression
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ectopic-expression>of myosins were reduced or suppressed when profilin <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/profilin> expression was reduced. This observation suggests that formins, being torque-sensitive and a major interactor of profilin, may be involved in the process.

Finally, microtubules may also participate in the transmission of
chirality across scales, even though their contribution to symmetry
breaking is usually described without invoking their intrinsic chirality
[106 <#bib0530>]. For example, dynein motors can have helical
trajectories along microtubule and generate a torque [107 <#bib0535>].
Several recent studies show that actin filaments and microtubules are
often co-regulated [108 <#bib0540>,109 <#bib0545>]. A thorough
understanding of how actin filament helicity organizes asymmetry in
cells will certainly require inclusion of microtubules in the picture.

          How torque on formins is relaxed strongly affects cellular

    Various proteins could play a role in cellular chirality. It was
    suggested that cellular chiral rotation resulted from the chiral
    interaction between actin and formin (10–15), as the helical
    rotation of actin filaments was clearly observed (14) and the
    torsional force (16) on actin filaments was measured as they grew
    from artificial formin mDia1 aggregates. It was also found that
    actin filaments gliding in chiral paths driven by Myo1D would
    generate de novo twisting of Drosophila cells (17).

    Chirality is a common and essential characteristic at varied scales
    of living organisms. By adapting the rotational clutch-filament
    model we previously developed, we investigate the effect of torque
    relaxation of a formin on cellular chiral swirling. Since it is
    still unclear how the torque on a formin is exactly relaxed, we
    probe three types of torque relaxation, as suggested in the
    literature. Our analysis indicates that, when a formin periodically
    undergoes positive and negative rotation during processive capping
    to relax the torque, cells hardly rotate. When the switch between
    the positive and the negative rotation during the processive capping
    is randomly regulated by the torque, our analysis indicates that
    cells can only slightly rotate either counterclockwise or clockwise.
    When a formin relaxes the torque by transiently loosening its
    contact either with the membrane at its anchored site or with the
    actin filament, we find that cells can prominently rotate either
    counterclockwise or clockwise, in good consistency with the
    experiment. Thus, our studies indicate that how the torque on a
    formin is relaxed strongly affects cellular swirling and suggest an
    efficient type of torque relaxation in switching cellular swirling.

          Myosin and gelsolin cooperate in actin filament severing and
          actomyosin motor activity
          <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820001775>

    Actin is a major intracellular protein with key functions in
    cellular motility, signaling, and structural rearrangements. Its
    dynamic behavior, such as polymerization and depolymerization of
    actin filaments in response to intracellular and extracellular cues,
    is regulated by an abundance of actin binding proteins. Out of
    these, gelsolin is one of the most potent for filament severing.
    However, myosin motor activity also fragments actin filaments
    through motor-induced forces, suggesting that these two proteins
    could cooperate to regulate filament dynamics and motility. To test
    this idea, we used an /in vitro/ motility assay, where actin
    filaments are propelled by surface-adsorbed heavy meromyosin (HMM)
    motor fragments. This allows studies of both motility and filament
    dynamics using isolated proteins. Gelsolin, at both nanomolar and
    micromolar Ca^2+ concentration, appreciably enhanced actin filament
    severing caused by HMM-induced forces at 1 mM MgATP, an effect that
    was increased at higher HMM motor density. This finding is
    consistent with cooperativity between actin filament severing by
    myosin-induced forces and by gelsolin. We also observed reduced
    sliding velocity of the HMM-propelled filaments in the presence of
    gelsolin, providing further support of myosin-gelsolin
    cooperativity. Total internal reflection fluorescence
    microscopy–based single molecule studies corroborated that the
    velocity reduction was a direct effect of gelsolin binding to the
    filament and revealed different filament severing pattern of
    stationary and HMM propelled filaments. Overall, the results
    corroborate cooperative effects between gelsolin-induced alterations
    in the actin filaments and changes due to myosin motor activity
    leading to enhanced F-actin severing of possible physiological
    relevance.

          Gelsolin-mediated actin filament severing in crowded
          environments

    Further, molecular dynamics simulations suggest over-twisting of
    filament double helical structure occurs in the presence of crowders
    [22]. Filament over-twisting may alter ABP binding and functional
    interactions [23]. For example, changes in filament twist have been
    shown to modulate the binding and severing activity of cofilin [24,25].

    Show abstract

    Gelsolin is a calcium-regulated actin binding protein that severs
    and caps actin filaments. Gelsolin’s severing activity is important
    for regulating actin filament assembly dynamics that are required
    for cell motility as well as survival. The majority of /in vitro/
    studies of gelsolin have been performed in dilute buffer conditions
    which do not simulate the molecular interactions occurring in the
    crowded intracellular environment. We hypothesize that crowding
    results in greater gelsolin severing activity due to induced
    conformational changes in actin filaments and/or gelsolin. In this
    study, we evaluated the effects of crowding on gelsolin-mediated
    actin filament severing and gelsolin binding to actin filaments in
    crowded solutions, utilizing total internal reflection fluorescence
    (TIRF) microscopy and co-sedimentation assays. Our data indicates
    that the presence of crowders causes a decrease in the rate of
    gelsolin severing as well as a decrease in the amount of gelsolin
    bound to actin filaments, with greater effects caused by the
    polymeric crowder. Despite the severing rate decrease,
    gelsolin-mediated filament severing is increased in the presence of
    crowders. Understanding the crowding effect on gelsolin-mediated
    actin filament severing offers insight into the interactions between
    gelsolin and actin that occur inside the crowded cytoplasm.
